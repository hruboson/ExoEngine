# ExoEngine
3D graphcs engine built on the Vulkan API.
### Application
The application built on this engine is a Virtual Solar System. It's not as fancy as it could be, but it's a start (This was also my 1st take on 3D graphics (〃￣ω￣〃)ゞ).

# Download and run the application
You can download the app binaries and all additional files [here](https://tinyurl.com/exoengine).
To run download the whole folder, unzip it ('duh), and run the file exo.exe.

# Purpose
This engine was initially made for my own study purposes, but there is a chance I will work on this more (when I have free time). It breaks my heart to abandon this project for now but I'm sure I will come stronger. ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ 

# Documentation
I made quite nice documentation/paper for this project. The problem is it was for my school so it's in czech language, so I'm not gonna post it here.
But thorough english documentation is planned, so stay tuned (for the next 100 years).

# FYI
If you want to copy, study or do anything else with the code you are welcome. I will not allow any pull requests as this isn't really public project. You are free to fork it and do anything you want with it.

## Dependencies
The engine is built mainly on Vulkan API and other additional libraries.

#### Additional libraries
- TinyObjectLoader
- STB library
- GLFW
- GLM
